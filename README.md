# YouTube Subscription Management Extension

## Overview
This extension allows users to manage their YouTube subscriptions efficiently. It provides the ability to extract a list of all subscriptions from an existing account, unsubscribe from channels, and resubscribe to selected channels using a different account. This tool is especially useful for users who want to transition to a new account while maintaining control over their data.

## Problem Statement
Many users rely on third-party applications to manage YouTube subscriptions, which often require logging in with Google credentials. This poses privacy concerns as these apps gain access to sensitive account information. Creating a secondary account as a workaround results in a lack of subscription data, making it difficult to start afresh without losing existing preferences.

## Features
1. **Extract Subscriptions:** Export a list of all subscribed channels from an existing YouTube account.
2. **Bulk Unsubscribe:** Unsubscribe from all channels in one click to declutter your account.
3. **Selective Resubscribe:** Resubscribe to selected channels on a new or existing account using the extracted list.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the extension in your preferred browser (detailed steps vary by browser; see below).
3. Grant the necessary permissions to allow the extension to access subscription data.

## How to Use
1. **Extract Subscriptions:**
   - Log in to your original YouTube account.
   - Click on the extension and select the "Extract Subscriptions" option.
   - Save the extracted subscription list as a file.

2. **Unsubscribe from All Channels:**
   - Use the extension's "Bulk Unsubscribe" feature to remove all existing subscriptions.

3. **Resubscribe:**
   - Log in to the new YouTube account.
   - Upload the previously saved subscription list.
   - Click on "Resubscribe" to subscribe to the channels in the list.

## Privacy
This extension is designed to work locally on your browser. No data is sent to external servers, ensuring your credentials and subscription data remain secure.
